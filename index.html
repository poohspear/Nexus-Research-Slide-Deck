					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p align="left">
						Currently the TVc monitor team are collecting the TV streaming with many receivers.
						The cost per year is around 200 usd for each channel and there are more than 200 channels.
					</p>
					<p align="left">
						Researchers are now recording the data manually with data entry staffs and it's
						take more than 8 hours to complete 24 hours streaming.
						There are more than 200 TV Channels and in this way they need more than 100 receivers.
						Researchers need 10 to 25 data entry staffs to complete the process. The cost for the employee would be 2,000 usd to 5,000 usd.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Secret</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>We are going to collect the web streaming URL directly into the web server.</li>
						<li>In this way, we can reduct the cost. The cost have to be less than 1,000 usd for hundred numbers of channels.</li>
						<li>We are going to use audio fingerpring technology.</li>
						<li>That can analyse 24 hours streaming within few minutes.</li>
						<li>And there are only one media monitor staff reuquire to handel that 200 channels.</li>
						<li>In this way we can reduce the cost into 1/10.</li>
					</ol>
